# Status-Cats-Discord
Allows you to get status code images from https://http.cat 

This is currently a WIP and by no means finished!

You can add it to your Discord by following [this link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=769939298371108895&permissions=2048&scope=bot)

# Usage
You can use a command like `!status 303` and if possible, it'll return the image from https://http.cat 

# Limitations
Currently this only runs off my local machine but I'll get it online in the coming days
